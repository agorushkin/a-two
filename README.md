🕹️ `Lightweight steam A2 interface implementation`

## 📝 Specification

### A lot of base code for the project was taken from [giyomoon](https://github.com/GiyoMoon/steam-server-query)

I took the GameServer fragment of his code and attempted to rewrite it with Deno
tools with few improvements et cetera.
